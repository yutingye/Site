<p>-- blur 8: I calculated the (2*n+1)*(2*n+1) filter using Gaussian formula, 
where <font face="Times New Roman">&#963;=1. </font>But it didn't blur much. </p>
<p>-- sharp (cannot remember the parameter): I extrapolated with the blur image 
using 2.0 as parameter. But due to the above reason, it doesn't sharpen much.</p>
<p>-- contrast 2.0</p>
<p>-- noise 0.5</p>
<p>-- quantize 2</p>
<p>-- random Dither, ordered Dither, Floyd Steinberg Dither: They're all quantized to 2 bits.<br> I don't know why my 
dithering are all brighter than what the sample program generates. I know I'm 
doing right, but still wondering why they're different.</p>
<p>-- extract channel 0 </p>
<p>-- saturation -0.5</p>
<p>-- crop 450 320 -500 -200:&nbsp; I considered the negative width and height 
values valid but of opposite direction</p>
<p>-- edge Detect: I only used a 3*3 filter, so it's not so obvious</p>
<p>-- fun: cosine, it can be used as reflection of water in animation</p>
<p>-- rotate 240</p>
<p>-- scale 0.5 1.5</p>
<p>-- art:&nbsp; emboss, using bump map+contrast(4)+blur(2)&nbsp; It's quite 
trivial, but I like the effect:-)</p>
