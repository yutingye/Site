<p><b>Commands:</b></p>
-d dimension : specify the dimension of the cube, it's n*n*n<br>
-t turn_time : how much time to take a turn<br>
-s scramble_times: how many turns to scramble the cube<br>
-f : to solve the cube in animation<br>
-r: reset the cube to a solved state<br>
-t: toggle texture (not so well, i dunno why i can only load half of the 
texture maps)<br>
-p: pause or resume the animation <br>
<p><b>Implementation:</b></p>
<p>I didn't treat it as a combination of small cubes but of small squares. 
Basically I have 6 facets, each of which is consisted of an n*n array. Each 
element in these arrays stores the color and texture information, as well as the 
rotate angle of the small square it represents.</p>
<p>I wanted to use display list, but I dunno why it could not display texture. I 
have to replace the glCallList() with actual rendering code. I used glPushMatrix 
and glPopMatrix extensively to preserve the matrix of each little square.</p>
<p>The textures are a bit off. First it takes a long time to load all the 
textures (since they look identical, i dun see why we have to use all the 54 
textures, anyway...). And I simply repeat mapping the same set of textures to 
larger cubes which makes the logo appears several times( i guess it's the 
white5.raw?). *I maybe mess up the orientations of the facets so 3 of them do not 
display the textures. What I don't know is why the colors of the squares and the 
colors of their textures are not the same. </p>
<p>The 3d manipulation is odd. I referenced
<a href="http://www.psychology.nottingham.ac.uk/staff/cr1/3d.html">3D Controls
</a>and chose <b>Vector and Roll </b>because it's natural with opengl. But the 
biggest problem is I don't how to combine each rotation. What I do is turn off 
glLoadIdentity() so the rotations can be accumulated. But it doesn't work when 
refreshing the screen, say animation or resizing... I also tried to use <b>
Elevation and Azimuth</b> to represent rotations, but I don't have time to make 
it work well. BTW, powerful as Quaternion is, it's too complicated for me to 
figure out :'(&nbsp;<br>

<p>*Well, I know why it's do weird now. I made a silly mistake in indexing the 
textures to each facet :(</p>
